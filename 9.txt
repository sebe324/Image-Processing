Asciify

This algorithm represents an image
in ASCII characters based on their light level.

First the input image is downscaled by a
divider, then the pixel is converted to
an ASCII character and placed onto
corresponding position to the
output image.

Use the Q/E keys to decrease/increase
the divider.
Use the A/D keys to decrease/increase
font size.
