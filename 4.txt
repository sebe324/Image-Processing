Convolution

In this example, a 3 by 3 kernel
"scans" an image. 
The kernel multiplies a pixel
by it's corresponding kernel value and then
adds it to the sum. After 9 additions the
central pixel is changed to the sum. 
Then the kernel moves to another pixel.

Use the Q/W/E keys to change kernels.
Q - blur kernel
W - sharpen kernel
E - cool effect kernel
